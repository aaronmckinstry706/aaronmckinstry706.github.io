### Me

I'm a Java developer just now entering the web development space; I'm also trained in deep learning techniques, and frequently use Python for scripting the boring stuff. 


### This Blog

This blog is meant to be both a showcase of my work and (sometimes) a public notepad for organizing and recording my thoughts in a coherent manner.
